# Snake
This repository contains the .java files for my Snake game that I coded with a partner for my final project as a Junior in High School.

The game is similar to regular snake, but has an added twist of special "power-up" blocks.

The bulk of the gameplay are primarily coded in the Screen class, and the set-up for the graphics are in the Frame class.

Not included in the files are a bunch of images for the gameplay, as well as audio files used during the game.
